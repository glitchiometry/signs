# signs
A very basic (and very preliminary) program meant to explore SDL's render.h functionalities (while strengthening visual associative memory.)  The hope is that this will develop into a "fully fledged" ASL learning/training/self-study program (that does more than scratch the surface.)

Directions:
- Self explanatory for letters,
- With a number, press 'enter' after inputting a guess (hopefully this will be fleshed out with more elaborate examples in the near future.)

TBD: 
- facilitate adding new samples to existing repositories (and translations), with automatic naming/conversion to bmp format
- facilitate adding "translations" or permissible answers, to make the program more user-friendly/forgiving.
- develop/build on the "report" offered at the end of each use (e.g. allow users to load specific profiles to append to existing datasets)
- allow 'timed' review, to measure fluency

Right now (and probably for the foreseeable future) there will necessarily be an emphasis on interpretation. Eventually, I think it would be neat to incorporate a 
generative element with image or video, which could be evaluated on subsequent cumulative interpretability statistics (relative to other/later user-generated samples.)
